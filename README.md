#How To Build:
Requirements: 
1)CMake
2)GCC compiler
Next:
clone CLove into your machine then make a new folder inside the cloned folder.Go into build and call ../cmake && make. After that you'll have an executable named love

# Love
My implementation of Love2d inside C using OpenGL 2. This means that Love runs on Desktop and Web.
In the future,when the framework will be fully stable there will be added : Android and 3D.
This framework is not made to be a fully copy of Love, so be aware of changes!
